                    A total solar eclipse happens when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth, completely blocking the face of the Sun. People located in the center of the Moon’s shadow when it hits Earth will experience a total eclipse. The sky will darken, as if it were dawn or dusk. Weather permitting, people in the path of a total solar eclipse can see the Sun’s corona, the outer atmosphere, which is otherwise usually obscured by the bright face of the Sun. A total solar eclipse is the only type of solar eclipse where viewers can momentarily remove their eclipse glasses (which are not the same as regular sunglasses) for the brief period of time when the Moon is completely blocking the Sun. The next total solar eclipse in the U.S. will be on April 8, 2024.

                    <h3>annular Solar Eclipse</h3>
                    An annular solar eclipse happens when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth, but when it is at or near its farthest point from Earth. Because the Moon is farther away from Earth, it appears smaller than the Sun and does not completely cover the Sun. As a result, the Moon appears as a dark disk on top of a larger, bright disk, creating what looks like a ring around the Moon. The next annular eclipse in the U.S. will be on Oct. 14, 2023.
                    
                    <h3>prrtial Solar Eclipse</h3>
                    A partial solar eclipse happens when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth but the Sun, Moon, and Earth are not perfectly lined up. Only a part of the Sun will appear to be covered, giving it a crescent shape. During a total or annular solar eclipse, people outside the area covered by the Moon’s inner shadow see a partial solar eclipse.
                    
                    
                    
                    <h3>hybird Solar Eclipse</h3>
                    Because Earth's surface is curved, sometimes an eclipse can shift between annular and total as the Moon’s shadow moves across the globe. This is called a hybrid solar eclipse.

                    When the moon passes through the Earth's shadow, it causes the Moon to look very unusual for a short period of time. This event is called a lunar eclipse, and it occurs roughly twice a year.
                During a lunar eclipse, Earth's shadow consists of the umbra (inner part, where there is no sunlight) and the penumbra (outer part, where there is some sunlight). Depending on the Moon's trajectory, there can be three types of lunar eclipses:
                <h3>•	Penumbral eclipse:</h3>
                the Moon crosses Earth's penumbra
                <h3>•	Partial eclipse: </h3>
                the Moon partially crosses Earth's umbra
                <h3>•	Total eclipse:</h3>
                the Moon completely crosses Earth's umbra

                    <h3>How often do lunar eclipses occur?</h3>
                    There are on average two lunar eclipses per year, although there can be as many as three to five of them in a year. For example, three eclipses took place in 2002, and astronomers are expecting four in 2020. A total lunar eclipse, also called a Blood Moon, happens in 37.3% of all lunar eclipses.
                    
                    <h3>Why do only some people on Earth see an eclipse at a given time?</h3>
                    Getting a chance to see a total solar eclipse is rare. The Moon’s shadow on Earth isn’t very big, so only a small portion of places on Earth will see it. You have to be on the sunny side of the planet when it happens.
